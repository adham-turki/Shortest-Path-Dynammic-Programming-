# Shortest-Path-Dynammic-Programming-
this is a program that solve minimum cost for traveling from city 1 to city2 Problem using 
Dynamic Programming technique.
Problem definition:
1. Travelling from home in city1 to a hotel in city2.
2. N stopovers on the way
a. a number of choices of towns for each stop,
b. a number of hotels to choose from in each city.
